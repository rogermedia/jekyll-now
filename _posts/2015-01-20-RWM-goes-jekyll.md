title: New Roger Williams Media post using Jekyll on Git Hub!
---

This is the first post for **Roger Williams Media** on the **[Jekyll]** blogging *plaftorm* using the **[GitHub]** hosting system. This is a big change for your author, Roger, who has been using Wordpress to create his and his clients websites since 2003. Lately he has been experiencing a number of issues that are leading him to find an alternative:

1. Complexity
2. Accessibility
3. Speed
4. Security
5. Cost

Lets look at each of those points in more detail:
## Complexity
[Wordpress] is a database driven blog or **[Content Management System](CMS)**. This means you have to use *database software* like **[MySQL]** and learn all about how they work. You have to create a new login for that database and then create one for the site you are running. Things can go wrong with the database and you either fix them or hire someone to fix them. This is complex for a marketer who just wants to get his and his clients content online for customers to find.

**Jekyll** is just HTML, CSS, and Javascript files. There is no database involved. This is the opposite of complex, aka **simple**.

## Accessibility
In order to update [Wordpress] you have to login to the website and navigate to various sections of the User Interface to make updates. Teaching this to clients can be very difficult and if you dont have an internet connection you cannot make any changes at all. This is not very accessible.

[Jekyll] uses [GitHub] which allows you to work on files on your local computer anytime with or without an internet connection. The files are all plain text with can be updated by many differnt text editors that are included on all computers. It uses Markdown to formatting which is an easy to use and understand markup language that converts into HTML without the ugliness of HTML.

## Speed
[Wordpress] uses a database which means it has to check in with the database pretty much anytime something happens. This can be slow especially as it gets larger and maybe isn't maintained as much as it should be.

[Jekyll] does not use a database. It is just plain old text files that are super small and fast to load.

## Security
[Wordpress] uses a database which can be hacked into in many different ways. Additionally Wordpress has very little security built into it and can suffer DDoS attacks.

[Jekyll] does not use a Database so those security concerns are eliminated. Additionally Jekyll if run on GitHub uses SSL security to confirm that anyone accessing the files has explicit permission to do so. This goes well beyond what Wordpress has installed.

## Cost
[Wordpress] requires a hosting account with database capabilities. This costs at least $5 per month and up.

[Jekyll] can be run on [GitHub] for **FREE**.

Thats a pretty quick overview of why Roger Williams Media is moving over to Jekyll. More updates will be coming soon.
